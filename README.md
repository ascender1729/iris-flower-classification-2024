# Iris Flower Classification Analysis

The Iris Flower Classification Analysis is a machine learning project that explores and analyzes the famous Iris flower dataset. This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Overview

This project includes data exploration, visualization, and a step-by-step implementation of KNN. The pair plot visualization aids in understanding the relationship between different features and their impact on the classification of Iris species.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analysis of the Iris dataset to understand its characteristics.
- **Data Visualization**: Use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing data relationships.
- **Machine Learning Implementation**: Application of the KNN algorithm to classify Iris species.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy assessment of the machine learning model.

## Data Description

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
