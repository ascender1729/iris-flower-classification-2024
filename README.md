# Iris Flower Classification Analysis

The Iris Flower Classification Analysis is a machine learning project that explores and analyzes the famous Iris flower dataset. This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Overview

This project includes data exploration, visualization, and a step-by-step implementation of KNN. The pair plot visualization aids in understanding the relationship between different features and their impact on the classification of Iris species.

## Features

- *Data Exploration*: Analysis of the Iris dataset and the Bezdek's Iris dataset to understand their characteristics.
- *Data Visualization*: Use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing data relationships through plots like pair plots and box plots.
- *Machine Learning Implementation*: Application of the KNN algorithm to classify Iris species, including cross-validation to find the optimal number of neighbors.
- *Model Evaluation*: Use of metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix to evaluate the model performance.

## Data Description

The Iris dataset contains samples of Iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
